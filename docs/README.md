# hexo-theme-doc-seed

This project is a skeleton for a documentation website using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and [hexo-theme-doc](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc).   
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your documentation website.

The seed contains the required structure and files to use Hexo and the theme, plus dummy content to show the usage of the main features of the theme.
