Before sending the pull request, make sure that:

- [ ] `gulp build` runs without issues.
- [ ] if you develop a catmod, a test project and docs are also present. Put a test project into a catmod's directory.
- [ ] if it is a work-in-progress, explicitly mark it as such in the title with the `WIP: ` prefix.
- [ ] The title of the pull request has a suitable emoji from [the Comigoji guide](https://comigo.gitlab.io/comigoji/#gitmoji). The title *will* look broken on GitHub, but it streamlines further merging and makes writing a pretty changelog easier.
