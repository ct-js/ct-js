  Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I marked this issue as stale as it hadn't brought much attention for quite a while.
  
  I do understand that stale issues are still issues, yet here stale issues receive the least attention from maintainers so they can focus on more relevant tasks.
  You can help with this issue by checking whether it affects latest versions of ct.js and writing about it if it does,
  providing an example project and steps to reproduce.  
  Or maybe you can close it with a PR!
  
  Note that some platform-dependent issues can't be resolved by developers due to the absense of such devices :c
  We will need help from you for such tasks.
  
  If this issue won't get attention in three months, it will be closed.
