This module abstracts the Web Pointer API, allowing you to track any type of pointers: mouses, touch events, tablet pens, or anything else that is supported by one's system.

The module replaces `ct.mouse` and `ct.touch` from previous versions, uniting their API and adding new features, like pressure and pen position reading. `ct.touch` may still be required on iOS.
