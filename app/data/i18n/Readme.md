# Translating ct.js

This folder contains translation files for ct.js. To create a translation, create a new `.json` file and edit its keys. You can use any text editor to translate it, or use [JSONBabel](https://comigo.itch.io/jsonbabel) or other tools to make life easier. JSONBabel is free, doesn't require installation and is made by Comigo (who created ct.js as well). For this exact tool, import files `Comments.json` and `English.json` — you don't need other files to translate ct.js.

Use the `Debug` translation in ct.js to see which keys are used across the app.

When you finish your translation, open a pull request to add it to the main repo so it becomes available to everyone. If you are not familiar with GitHub and source control systems in general, you can post your translation file at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CggbPkb).
