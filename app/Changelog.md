## v3.3.0

*Thu Dec 14 2023*

### ✨ New Features

* Ct.js now adds hash sums of exported files' names to textures, icons, and your game's source code. It makes it easier to update your games on your own servers and prevents the usage of outdated assets for your players. Note that index.html file should never be cached — the other assets can now be cached. Sounds are currently left with the old behavior as I have bigger plans for them and hashing large sound files is probably not the best idea. If you need to cache-invalidate a sound asset (say, by replacing one sound file with another), you can recreate the sound asset under the same name.
  Partially closes #409
* In the room editor, copies now show their templates' names when you hover them.
* Support for TypeScript in custom scripts
* Catmods: New Supabase Module (#425 by @ehanahamed)
