Ct.js is a 2D game editor that makes its bet on good documentation, visual tools and smooth workflow.

For bugs, feature requests, developing questions, please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js/issues) so we can better track  them. For general support about making games, ask a question at our [discord server](https://discord.gg/CggbPkb).

## Contributors needed!

Ct.js is a project maintained by CoMiGo, and programmed mainly by them as well, with little support from [dear contributors](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js/graphs/contributors) and translators. And *it sucks!* Ct.js is a good game editor, but can be the best one, and one developer is not enough to transition it from a dream to a reality.

If you are willing to participate in ct.js' future, contact me at Discord (CoMiGo#7821) or Telegram (@CoMiGo). Or jump straightly to the [main dev board](https://github.com/orgs/ct-js/projects/1) for current issues.

## Support ct.js on product-hunting sites:

* [Like ct.js on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/ct-js/)
* [Rate ct.js on Slant in different questions](https://www.slant.co/options/30242/~ct-js-review)

# Production builds

See the [releases page](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js/releases) or [jump to itch.io page](https://comigo.itch.io/ct). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

# Nightly builds

We have [daily builds at itch.io](https://comigo.itch.io/ct-nightly). This page will have nightly versions that are built from the `develop` branch from our repository. It means that you will get the latest features, improvement, bug fixes, and new bugs daily, out of the oven. [Itch.io app](https://itch.io/app) is strongly recommended.

# Repo structure & tools

* `app` — an [NW.js app](https://nwjs.io/), with its configs and static files.
    * `data`
        * `ct.release` — the ct.js game library, aka its "core"
        * `ct.libs` — catmods (modules) that ship with ct.js. Feel free to create a pull request with your module!
        * `i18n` — UI language schemes. Open for pull requests! :)
* `src` — a source folder that compile into `/app` folder at a build time.
    * `js` — different top-level scripts, including 3rd-party libraries.
    * `node_requires` — these are copied as is to the `/app` directory upon building ct.js, contain reusable code, and are meant to be used by `require('./data/node_requires/…')`.
    * `pug` — HTML sources of editor's windows, written in [Pug](https://pugjs.org/).
    * `riotTags` — components that drive all the logic in ct.js. Written in [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) and [Riot.js v3](https://v3.riotjs.now.sh/).
    * `styl` — style sheets, written in [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/).
* `branding` — logos and icons belong here.
* `docs` — official docs of ct.js. Edit them [here](https://github.com/ct-js/docs.ctjs.rocks).
* `DragonBonesJS` — a dependency for enabling DragonBones' skeletal animation support in ct.js.
* `SSCD.js` — [a fork](https://github.com/CosmoMyzrailGorynych/SSCD.js) of a collision library for ct.place.

# Developing ct.js

## Planning

See the [main dev board](https://github.com/orgs/ct-js/projects/1) for hot issues and plans for next releases. Prioritize the "Current release" column, then "To Do", then "Backlog", though if you really want a feature from a backlog to come true right here, right now, no one can stop you :)

Please leave a comment in issues you want to work on so that we can assign you to them and avoid occasional double work from several contributors.

## Forking and installing the dev environment

Building ct.js requires [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js.git ctjs
cd ./ctjs
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install
gulp -f devSetup.gulpfile.js
```

## Running ct.js from sources

```sh
gulp
```

Use `gulp dev` instead of just `gulp` to run a dev service with live-reloading without opening ct.js in its default manner. In either case, you can stop this service in the usual manner for your terminal, e.g. `Ctrl+C`. If you are encountering unexplained issues, especially when switching to a new branch, run `gulp -f devSetup.gulpfile.js` again.

VSCode can use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruakr.vsc-nwjs) to run ct.js with an attached debugger. Before running the debugger, to allow live-reloading, run `gulp dev`.

## Linting

Linting checks for code formatting issues, runs ESLint, and also checks i18n files for extra keys.

```sh
gulp lint
```

There are also separate commands for running specific tests only:

```sh
gulp lintJS
gulp lintTags
gulp lintStylus
gulp lintI18n
```

## Getting your changes into production

It's actually easy and robust. We have [regular ct.js](https://comigo.itch.io/ct) for core releases and [ct.js Nightly](https://comigo.itch.io/ct-nightly) as a canary/preview build.

* Once your PR was approved and merged, it gets into the `develop` branch.
* Every change to `develop` triggers a CI build, and a new version of [ct.js Nightly](https://comigo.itch.io/ct-nightly) is released publicly.
  * To automatically update ct.js Nightly, we recommend using [the official itch.io app](https://itch.io/app).
* Every now and then maintainers decide to release a public version of ct.js — it involves version bumping, creating and cleaning changelog, updating screenshot, website, presskit data and such. Some stuff is automated, but it still involves manual work and public announcements on different channels. But if your change got into `develop`, it means it will reach the `master` branch as well.

### Releasing ct.js

This is left for emergencies only, as Gitlab CI should prepare binaries for github and send them to itch.io as well

```sh
# Builds docs and adds them to ct.js app
gulp docs
# Recompiles source files, bundles docs, and bakes binaries
gulp packages

# Publishes prebuilt binaries to itch.io
# This assumes that you have an access to ct.js at itch.io :)
gulp deployItchOnly
gulp deployItchOnly --channel next # deploy to a specific itch.io channel

# Creates a draft release on GitHub
# Needs a GITHUB_TOKEN in your environment variables.
# Does nothing on nightly releases
gulp sendGithubDraft

# Combines `gulp packages`, `gulp sendGithubDraft`, and `gulp deployItchOnly`
gulp deploy
```

The first run will be slow as it will download nw.js binaries. Next runs will use cached files.

## Naming conventions and references

Use [Gitmoji-flavored Comigoji](https://comigo.gitlab.io/comigoji/#gitmoji) for naming your commits.

Use [Comigo's CSS naming guide](https://cosmomyzrailgorynych.github.io/css-naming-guide/) for styling

We have some references for ct.js' internals on [our wiki](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js/wiki).

The ct.js app has a built-in CSS stylebook in the Meta section of the main menu.
